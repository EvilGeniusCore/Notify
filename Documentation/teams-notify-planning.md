# `teams-notify` — Planning Document
> A C# / .NET 10 CLI tool and reusable NuGet library for sending Microsoft Teams notifications via the Graph API

## Purpose

This tool exists to send Teams messages to a specified channel or user so that scripts can be automated on servers in either Mac, Linux or Windows. It is NOT meant to replace built in integrations of platforms like Gitlab/Github or other platforms.

The consumers of the application would be any Admin, .NET user, or developer who needs to send Teams messages in a secured environment. This is an open source project distributed in two forms: a cross-platform CLI tool for scripts and pipelines, and a NuGet library (`TeamsNotify.Core`) for .NET applications that want to send Teams messages without shelling out to the CLI. Existing tools did not provide the cross-platform ease of use required, and no general-purpose Graph API wrapper for Teams messaging exists on NuGet.

## Problems With the Alternatives

| Approach | Why It Falls Short |
|---|---|
| Raw `curl` + bash | Not cross platform and takes a lot of scaffolding to do right |
| Incoming Webhooks | Explored — see below |
| Power Automate | Microsoft-specific tool |
| Existing Graph SDK directly | Too complicated from shell |

### Incoming Webhooks — Explored and Rejected

Incoming Webhooks were seriously considered as they require no Entra ID App Registration and are trivial to implement — just an HTTP POST to a URL. However, they were rejected for the following reasons:

- **Deprecated.** Microsoft deprecated Office 365 Connectors in 2024. The replacement is Workflows via Power Automate, which is already ruled out as a Microsoft-specific dependency.
- **One URL per channel.** Each webhook is tied to a single channel. Managing multiple channels means managing multiple URLs, whereas a single Graph API App Registration covers every team and channel the app has access to.
- **No user messaging.** Webhooks cannot send direct messages to a user — the `--to` flag would be impossible to implement.
- **No channel discovery.** The `list` command cannot be built on webhooks — there is no API to enumerate teams or channels.
- **Sender identity.** Messages always appear from a connector bot name, not a real identity.

The Graph API requires a one-time Entra ID App Registration and admin consent for `ChannelMessage.Send`, but that cost is paid once per organisation and unlocks all current and future channels without additional configuration.

## Core Use Cases

| Priority | Use Case | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Required | Send to a known channel | `teams-notify send --team DevOps --channel Alerts -m "done"` | Required |
| Very Low | Send to a user by email | `teams-notify send --to user@company.com -m "done"` | If we can without a lot of work, I have other ways to send mail in scripts |
| Medium | Pipe stdin as the message | `echo "done" \| teams-notify send --channel Alerts` | Would be nice but not required |
| Required | Send with a title / subject | `--subject "Build #42 Failed"` | Must have |
| Low | Send an Adaptive Card | structured notification with buttons/fields | Future possibility, need a use case where its needed |
| High | Read config from a file | for reuse across multiple channels | Will allow reuse and a single config location |
| Low | Multiple recipients at once | `--to a@x.com --to b@x.com` | Multi-channel support is nice but not a requirement — could be done in the script itself |
| High | Dry run / preview mode | `--dry-run` prints what would be sent | Should have a method where I can test it in a vacuum |

## Out of Scope

- Receiving / reading messages
- Managing teams or channels (create, delete)
- Uploading files or attachments
- Scheduling messages
- A daemon / long-running listener

## CLI Design — Commands & Flags

A single command that can be run on Linux, Windows or Mac called `teams-notify`.

``` bash
teams-notify [command] [options]

Commands:
  send        Send a message
  configure   Save default config (tenant, client, channel)
  list        List teams and channels — run with no arguments to list all teams, add --team <name|id> to list channels within a team
  version     Show version info

Send options:
  -m, --message <text>      Message body — required unless --file or stdin is used
  -f, --file <path>         Read message body from a file — required unless --message or stdin is used
  -t, --team <name|id>      Target team
  -c, --channel <name|id>   Target channel
      --to <email>          Send to a user chat instead
      --subject <text>      Optional subject/title
      --html                Treat message body as HTML (Teams subset: bold, italic, lists, links, code blocks)
      --dry-run             Print request, don't send
  -q, --quiet               Suppress output (exit code only)

Global options (apply to all commands):
      --env-file <path>     Load credentials and defaults from a key=value file, overrides env vars
```

### Message input — required

Every `send` call must supply exactly one of:

- `-m, --message <text>` — inline string
- `-f, --file <path>` — path to a file whose contents become the message body
- stdin — piped input, used only when neither `--message` nor `--file` is provided

If none of these are present the command fails immediately with exit code `1` and a clear error. If more than one is provided, `--file` takes precedence over `--message`, and both take precedence over stdin.

`--html` applies regardless of which input source is used. Combine `--file report.html --html` to send a pre-built HTML file.

### Team and channel resolution

`--team` and `--channel` accept either a GUID (used directly as an ID) or a name (resolved via a Graph API lookup). If the lookup finds no match the command fails with exit code `3`. Use `teams-notify list` once to find IDs for use in production scripts where stability matters.

If `--team` and `--channel` are omitted the tool falls back to `TEAMS_NOTIFY_DEFAULT_TEAM` and `TEAMS_NOTIFY_DEFAULT_CHANNEL` from whichever config source is active. If a destination cannot be resolved from any source the command fails with exit code `5` — a destination is required.

## Authentication

This tool authenticates using Client Credentials (app-only) via an Entra ID App Registration. Managed Identity is not supported as this tool is designed for cross-platform script environments, not Azure-hosted infrastructure.

### Reasoning

- The primary use case is automating scripts on Linux, Mac and Windows servers with no user present — Client Credentials is the only option that works unattended
- Consumers are admins and developers running the tool in pipelines and cron jobs, not interactively
- Being open source means users supply their own Entra ID App Registration — credentials via env vars is the standard pattern for this
- Client Credentials works identically on Linux, Windows, and Mac with no platform-specific dependencies
- Device Code Flow adds first-run browser friction, which contradicts the goal of replacing tools that require too much scaffolding
- Managed Identity only works inside Azure, which this tool explicitly does not require

### Requirements

- Entra ID App Registration with `client_id` + `client_secret`
- Admin consent granted for the `ChannelMessage.Send` permission
- Credentials supplied via `--env-file`, environment variables, or config file — see Configuration Design

## Configuration Design

### Credential resolution order

The tool resolves credentials and defaults in this order, stopping at the first source that provides a value:

1. `--env-file <path>` — explicitly passed key=value file, takes precedence over everything. If you pass this you intend it to be the authoritative source, overriding any ambient environment variables on the machine.
2. Environment variables — set in the shell, crontab, or container. Used when no `--env-file` is provided.
3. Config file — platform-appropriate location resolved by .NET (`AppData\Roaming` on Windows, `~/.config` on Linux/Mac). Written by `teams-notify configure`. Used as a persistent fallback for developer machines.
4. Error — exits with code `5` if required credentials are still missing.

### Supported variables

```
TEAMS_NOTIFY_TENANT_ID
TEAMS_NOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
TEAMS_NOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
TEAMS_NOTIFY_DEFAULT_TEAM
TEAMS_NOTIFY_DEFAULT_CHANNEL
```

All variables apply regardless of source — `--env-file`, environment, or config file.

### Typical usage patterns

| Scenario | Recommended source |
|---|---|
| Running a script on a system or in a container | Environment variables injected by the platform |
| Cron job or script folder | `--env-file ./teams.env` alongside other script artifacts |
| Developer laptop | `teams-notify configure` writes the config file once |

## Technical Stack

### `TeamsNotify.Core` — Library Dependencies

| Role | Package | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Graph API | `Microsoft.Graph` v5 | Strongly typed, handles paging + retry |
| Azure Auth | `Azure.Identity` | Client Credentials via app registration |
| Logging | `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` | Abstractions only — consumers supply the implementation |
| JSON | `System.Text.Json` | Already in the runtime |

### `TeamsNotify` — CLI-Only Dependencies

| Role | Package | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CLI framework | `System.CommandLine` | Stable in .NET 10, first-class MS support |
| Configuration | `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration` | + JSON + EnvVars providers |
| Logging impl | `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console` | Wires console output, respects `--quiet` |

`Microsoft.Graph` and `Azure.Identity` are pulled in transitively from `TeamsNotify.Core` — the CLI does not reference them directly.

### .NET 10 Features Worth Using

- **`[GeneratedRegex]`** — used for GUID detection when resolving `--team` and `--channel` values. The pattern is compiled into the binary at build time rather than at runtime. Not a performance requirement — the Graph API call that follows dwarfs any regex cost — but it is the correct modern .NET pattern and costs nothing to adopt.

### .NET Features We Are Avoiding

- **Native AOT** — `Microsoft.Graph` and `Azure.Identity` rely heavily on runtime reflection which is incompatible with AOT without significant annotation work that could break with SDK updates. The self-contained single file publish achieves no-runtime-dependency with none of the complexity.
- **`IHostedService` / Generic Host** — designed for long-running background services with a full DI container lifecycle. This tool executes a single command and exits. The Generic Host adds startup overhead and boilerplate that serves no purpose for a CLI with a sub-second lifetime.

### Separation of concerns

| Layer | Project | Knows about |
|---|---|---|
| Graph / auth logic | `TeamsNotify.Core` | `Microsoft.Graph`, `Azure.Identity`, `TeamsCredentials`, `SendMessageRequest` |
| Config loading | `TeamsNotify` (`ConfigService`) | env vars, files, platform paths → `AppConfig` → `TeamsCredentials` |
| CLI surface | `TeamsNotify` (`Commands/*`) | `System.CommandLine`, `ConfigService`, Core services |

`TeamsNotify.Core` has zero CLI dependencies and can be consumed directly by any .NET application via NuGet without shelling out to the CLI.

## Build Plan

Ordered by dependency — each phase can begin once the previous is complete.

### Phase 1 — Core Library (`TeamsNotify.Core`)

- [x] `TeamsCredentials` — already a `record` with `required` properties; no runtime validation needed
- [x] `SendMessageRequest` — already a `record` with `required` properties; no runtime validation needed
- [x] `AuthService` — implement `BuildGraphClientAsync()` using `ClientSecretCredential` from `Azure.Identity`
- [x] `GraphService` — implement `SendMessageAsync(SendMessageRequest)` — channel message with plain text or HTML body and optional subject line
- [x] `GraphService` — implement `ResolveTeamIdAsync()` and `ResolveChannelIdAsync()` — GUID passthrough + name lookup via Graph
- [x] `GraphService` — implement `ListTeamsAsync()` and `ListChannelsAsync()`
- [x] `TeamsNotify.Core.Tests` — unit tests: GUID detection, name resolution input parsing

### Phase 2 — CLI (`TeamsNotify`)

- [x] `AppConfig.Validate()` — assert required credential fields are non-null before calling `ToCredentials()`
- [x] `ConfigService.LoadAsync()` — resolve credentials from `--env-file` → env vars → config file → exit code `5`
- [x] `ConfigService.SaveAsync()` / `GetConfigFilePath()` — persist defaults written by `teams-notify configure`
- [x] `Program.cs` — wire `--env-file` as a global option and thread it through to `ConfigService`
- [x] `SendCommand` — implement all options: `--message`, `--file`, stdin, `--team`, `--channel`, `--subject`, `--html`, `--dry-run`, `--quiet`
- [x] `ListCommand` — implement `--team` option; no argument lists all teams, with `--team` lists channels within it
- [x] `ConfigureCommand` — implement interactive/option-based save of tenant, client ID/secret, and channel defaults
- [x] Version command — output assembly version and target framework
- [x] `TeamsNotify.Tests` — unit tests: arg parsing, config resolution order, exit code mapping, `--dry-run` output

### Phase 3 — Polish & Release

- [x] Review all `--help` text across every command for clarity and completeness. Do we provide man pages for linux/mac?
- [x] `Build.ps1` and `Build.sh` — automate self-contained publish for all five platform targets
- [x] Smoke test self-contained binaries on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- [ ] Integration tests against a real Entra ID tenant and Teams environment *(blocked — waiting on tenant credentials from Glen)*
- [x] `TeamsNotify.Core` NuGet metadata review — description, tags, package README
- [x] Repository README — installation options, quick start, required Graph API permissions

## Distribution

Two artifacts are published from this repository.

### `TeamsNotify.Core` — NuGet Library

Published to NuGet.org as `TeamsNotify.Core`. Consumed by .NET applications that want to send Teams messages directly without the CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package TeamsNotify.Core
```

### `TeamsNotify` — CLI Tool

Distributed in two forms:

**Self-contained binaries** — all .NET dependencies bundled into a single executable. No .NET runtime required on the target machine. Drop it anywhere and run it.

All targets built with `PublishSingleFile=true` and `--self-contained true`:

- `win-x64` — `teams-notify.exe`
- `linux-x64` — `teams-notify`
- `linux-arm64` — `teams-notify`
- `osx-x64` — `teams-notify`
- `osx-arm64` — `teams-notify`

Build scripts (PowerShell and Bash) will be provided to automate publishing across all targets.

**dotnet global tool** — for users who already have the .NET runtime and prefer a smaller install:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g teams-notify
```

## Error Handling & Exit Codes

CI/CD pipelines depend on exit codes. Define them up front.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | General error |
| `2` | Auth failure |
| `3` | Team/channel not found — value was provided as a name, Graph lookup returned no match |
| `4` | Graph API error (throttled 429, server error 5xx) |
| `5` | Configuration missing or destination cannot be resolved |

### Graph API throttling

The `Microsoft.Graph` SDK has built-in retry handling for 429 and 503 responses, including honouring the `Retry-After` header returned by the API. This is sufficient — no custom retry logic will be added. If the SDK exhausts its retry attempts the command fails with exit code `4`. This behaviour is documented so callers can handle it in their scripts if needed.

## Testing Strategy

Unit tests and integration tests are kept separate with a clear boundary between them. Two test projects map to the two source projects.

### `TeamsNotify.Core.Tests` — Library unit tests

Test Core logic that does not require a network or credentials:

- GUID detection for `--team` and `--channel` resolution
- Name-to-ID resolution logic (input parsing, error cases)
- `AppConfig` validation (missing required fields)

No mocking of the Graph client. If a piece of logic requires mocking the Graph client to test it, that is a signal the logic should be separated from the API call.

### `TeamsNotify.Tests` — CLI unit tests

Test CLI behaviour that does not require a network or credentials:

- Command argument parsing and validation (required fields, mutual exclusivity of `--message` / `--file` / stdin)
- Config resolution order (`--env-file` → env vars → config file → error)
- Exit code mapping for each error condition
- `--dry-run` output formatting

### Integration tests

Run against a real Entra ID tenant and real Teams environment. These are not run in standard CI — they require credentials and are run manually or in a dedicated pipeline with secrets configured.

- `send` successfully delivers a message to a known channel
- `list` returns teams and channels for the configured app registration
- Auth failure produces exit code `2`
- Invalid team name produces exit code `3`
- `--env-file` credentials override environment variables

## HTML Specification — Teams Supported Tags

When `--html` is passed, the message body is sent with `contentType: html`. Teams renders the following HTML subset. Anything outside this list is stripped or ignored by Teams.

### Supported tags

| Tag | Renders as | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `<b>`, `<strong>` | Bold | |
| `<i>`, `<em>` | Italic | |
| `<s>` | Strikethrough | |
| `<u>` | Underline | |
| `<pre>` | Code block | Monospace, preserves whitespace |
| `<code>` | Inline code | Monospace, inline |
| `<br>` | Line break | |
| `<p>` | Paragraph | Adds vertical spacing |
| `<ul>` / `<li>` | Unordered list | Bullet points |
| `<ol>` / `<li>` | Ordered list | Numbered list |
| `<blockquote>` | Quote block | Indented with left border |
| `<a href="...">` | Hyperlink | URL must be absolute |
| `<at>` | @mention | Teams-specific — requires the mention metadata object alongside the body |
| `<span>` | Inline container | Useful for combining with style attributes if Teams honours them |

### Unsupported / stripped

- Headings (`<h1>` through `<h6>`)
- Images (`<img>`)
- Tables (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`)
- CSS `style` attributes (generally ignored)
- `<script>`, `<iframe>`, and all other interactive/unsafe tags

### Example

```html
<b>Build Failed</b> — branch <code>main</code><br>
<ul>
  <li>Step: Unit Tests</li>
  <li>Exit code: 1</li>
</ul>
<a href="https://ci.example.com/builds/42">View build #42</a>
```

## Known Blocker — `ChannelMessage.Send` Does Not Exist as an Application Permission

### Problem

The original design assumes app-only (Client Credentials) authentication using the `ChannelMessage.Send` **Application permission** in Microsoft Graph. This design is fundamentally flawed.

Per the [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference), `ChannelMessage.Send` is a **Delegated permission only**:

> *"Allows an app to send channel messages in Microsoft Teams, on behalf of the signed-in user."*

There is no Application permission equivalent. Microsoft has never exposed app-only channel message sending as a standard tenant-wide Graph permission. The permission not appearing in the Azure portal during setup was not a gating or consent issue — it does not exist. The entire `ClientSecretCredential` auth path in `AuthService` and `GraphService` will fail at runtime for the send operation regardless of what permissions are granted.

This is a **design-level v1 blocker**, not a configuration issue. The codebase must be updated before integration testing or shipping.

### Proposed Solutions

#### Option 1 — RSC (Resource-Specific Consent)

Package the app as a Teams application and install it directly into each team it needs to post to. RSC provides a `ChannelMessage.Send.Group` permission scoped to that specific team, which does work app-only without a signed-in user. This is Microsoft's supported path for unattended app-only channel messaging.

**What changes in the code:**
- A Teams app manifest (`manifest.json`) must be created declaring the `ChannelMessage.Send.Group` RSC permission
- The manifest must be packaged as a `.zip` and sideloaded or published to the organisation's Teams app catalogue
- `AuthService` stays on Client Credentials — the auth mechanism does not change
- `GraphService.SendMessageAsync()` may need to confirm RSC-granted permissions are honoured by the standard channel message endpoint — this requires verification during integration testing

**Fallout:**
- The app must be manually installed into every team it needs to post to — this is ongoing operational overhead
- Sideloading requires IT/admin involvement for each team, which brings the Technical Services Committee into every new deployment
- Teams app packages have their own versioning and update lifecycle separate from the CLI binary and NuGet package
- Breaks the original "drop credentials in, point at any team" design goal — the app must already be installed in a team before it can post there
- Not suitable as a truly general-purpose tool across an organisation without a centralised app catalogue deployment

**Verdict:** The most viable path. Client Credentials auth is preserved, no licence cost, and it is Microsoft's documented supported approach for this scenario. The operational overhead is the main trade-off.

#### Option 2 — Service Account (Delegated Permissions)

Create a dedicated Microsoft 365 user account (e.g. `teams-notify@organisation.com`), grant it the Delegated `ChannelMessage.Send` permission, and authenticate as that user using the Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) flow — the only non-interactive delegated flow suitable for unattended automation.

A variation of this option is using an existing personal account rather than a dedicated service account. This avoids the licence cost but introduces its own problems — see fallout below.

**What changes in the code:**
- `AuthService` must be rewritten to use `UsernamePasswordCredential` from `Azure.Identity` instead of `ClientSecretCredential`
- `TeamsCredentials` must be extended to carry a username and password instead of a client secret
- All environment variable names and config file keys change — a breaking change for any consumer of `TeamsNotify.Core`
- All documentation, README, CLI manual, and the NuGet package readme require updates

**Fallout:**
- A dedicated M365 user licence costs money annually — explicitly identified as undesirable
- ROPC is deprecated by Microsoft and not recommended for new applications
- Storing a username and password as credentials is a weaker security model than Client Credentials
- MFA policies and password expiry on the service account can silently break unattended scripts with no warning
- Messages appear to come from the named user account rather than a neutral app identity, which looks odd in Teams
- Breaks the app-only design goal entirely

**Using a personal account instead of a dedicated service account:**
- Avoids the licence cost but every automated message appears in Teams as posted by that person personally
- MFA is almost certainly enabled on personal accounts in a government-managed tenant — ROPC does not support MFA and will fail outright
- The individual's password is stored in plaintext in env files and CI/CD secrets — a significant personal security risk
- Any password change, account lock, or policy rotation by IT immediately breaks all automation silently
- Government tenants typically enforce strict password rotation policies — this will fail on a predictable schedule
- Ties organisational automation to a single person's account — if they leave, everything breaks

**Verdict:** Not recommended in either form. Dedicated service account carries licence cost and deprecated auth. Personal account is worse — MFA incompatibility alone makes it non-viable on a government tenant, and it is poor security practice regardless.

### Recommended Path

1. Pursue RSC (Option 1) — it preserves the Client Credentials auth design and is Microsoft's supported approach
2. Work with the Technical Services Committee to get the Teams app sideloaded into the test team while Glen is on leave, so integration testing can proceed when he returns
3. Do not pursue Option 2

The codebase auth logic (`AuthService`, `GraphService`) does not need to change for RSC — the work is in creating the Teams app manifest and coordinating the sideload with IT. All other v1 work is complete.

Integration tests remain blocked until RSC is set up.

## Future Considerations

Items that are explicitly out of scope for v1 but worth revisiting in later versions.

### Adaptive Cards — `Microsoft.Teams.Cards`

The official Microsoft package [`Microsoft.Teams.Cards`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Teams.Cards) (Dec 2025, .NET 8+) builds Adaptive Card payloads for Teams, including Teams-specific card elements. It does not send — it is a payload builder only.

When the `--card` flag is implemented, this package should be evaluated as the card payload builder rather than rolling custom DTOs. It is actively maintained by Microsoft and targets .NET 8+, making it compatible with this project.

### File Payloads

Sending file attachments to a Teams channel or chat via the Graph API. The Graph API supports this but it is a multi-step operation: upload the file to SharePoint/OneDrive first, then attach the resulting share link or file ID to the message. This is non-trivial and has no current use case driving it, but it is a natural extension of the `send` command — e.g. `--attach report.pdf`.

This is currently listed as out of scope. Revisit when a concrete use case exists.
